<p>The second Ice Shelf-Ocean Model Intercomparison Project (ISOMIP+) is a set of
five experiments for ocean models with thermodynamically active ice shelf
cavities (i.e. with a parameterization of the sub-ice-shelf boundary layer
and of melt rates a the ice-ocean interface).  The experiments are described
in <a class="reference external" href="https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/9/2471/2016/">Asay-Davis et al. (2016)</a>.</p>
<p>ISOMIP+ is based on a earlier set of experiments,
<a class="reference external" href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003AGUFM.C41A..05H/abstract">ISOMIP</a>,
that was very idealized.  ISOMIP+ uses a more complex but still idealized ice
geometry.  It is a sister project of the third Marine Ice Sheet Model
Intercomparison Project
<a class="reference external" href="https://tc.copernicus.org/articles/14/2283/2020/tc-14-2283-2020.html">(MISMIP+)</a>,
which dynamics of an ice sheet and ice shelf with significant variability in
two horizontal dimensions.  Topography for ISOMIP+ comes from MISMIP+
simulations with the BISICLES model and can be
<a class="reference external" href="https://dataservices.gfz-potsdam.de/pik/showshort.php?id=escidoc:1487953">downloaded here</a>
(however, COMPASS will automatically download the topography, process it, and
regrid it to the MPAS mesh so users do not need to download it themselves).
ISOMIP+ uses far-field restoring over the full water column to force changes in
ocean conditions.  Restoring with a relatively warm far-field temperature
profile (the Ocean0 experiment) leads to a quasi-steady state within 1 to 2
year.  Two ISOMIP+ experiments prescribe dynamic topography, allowing models to
test their ability to handle moving boundaries and to see the effects that
moving topography has on ocean dynamics.</p>
<div class="section" id="com-2km-and-typ-5km-configurations">
<h2>COM (2km) and TYP (5km) configurations<a class="headerlink" href="#com-2km-and-typ-5km-configurations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Each of the five experiments can be performed in a “common” (COM) or a “typical”
(TYP) setup.  The COM setup prescribes canonical horizontal (2 km) and vertical
(36 layers, ~20 m) resolutions as well as a linear equation of state, a
linear equation for the freezing point,and prescribed values for several
coefficients including: a root-mean-squared “tidal” velocity to include in the
computation of the friction velocity; top and bottom drag coefficients;
and horizontal and vertical viscosity and diffusivity.  The COM experiments also
prescribe a method for computing the value of the heat- and salt-transfer
coefficients (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma_T\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma_S\)</span>) as part of the Ocean0
experiment described below.</p>
<p>The TYP experiments are intended to run at at resolutions typical for realistic
simulations performed with that ocean model and with typical parameter values.
The idea behind these experiments is to get a feel for how much these parameter
choices affect model spread compared with the COM choices.  For MPAS-Ocean, we
chose 5 km as our TYP resolution because, at the time, this was the target
resolution for our highest resolution simulations with ice-shelf cavities.
In practice, we have not run simulations with resolution this high.  But even
at 5 km resolution, the ISOMIP+ domain is not well resolved and the dynamics
are clearly affected by the poor resolution.  We are fully aware that we do not
capture small ice shelves like the one in ISOMIP+ in our typical MPAS-Ocean
simulations with ice-shelf cavities.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ocean0">
<h2>Ocean0<a class="headerlink" href="#ocean0" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Ocean0 uses steady-state ice topography from the initial steady state of a
MISMIP+ Ice1 experiment (also described in
<a class="reference external" href="https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/9/2471/2016/">Asay-Davis et al. (2016)</a>).
produced with the BISICLES ice-sheet model. The ocean is initialized with a
relatively warm profile and restored the same profile in the far field. The
combination of warm initial conditions and restoring leads the system to reach a
quasi-equilibrium with strong melting over a few months to a few years. Because
Ocean0 is expected to reach a quasi-equilibrium within approximately 1 year,
this experiment is well suited to parameter studies. In particular, this
experiment is used to calibrate the values of the heat- and salt-transfer
coefficients, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma_T\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma_S\)</span>, to achieve a target
melt rate of ~30 m/yr.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ocean1">
<h2>Ocean1<a class="headerlink" href="#ocean1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Ocean1 uses the same topography and restoring as Ocean0 but is initialized to a
colder, fresher profile that is expected to result in low melt rates during the
first several years of the simulation. Far-field restoring to the same warmer
profile as in Ocean0 leads to warmer and saltier water in the far field at
depth. The duration of the experiment is 20 years, which is typically sufficient
time to reach a quasi-steady state. Melt rates as well as the strengths of the
barotropic and overturning circulations toward the end of the simulation are
expected to be significantly larger than those within the first few years
because of the warming.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ocean2">
<h2>Ocean2<a class="headerlink" href="#ocean2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In Ocean2, the topography is from the end of the Ice1r simulation from BISICLES.
The ocean is initialized with the warm profile from Ocean0 and restored to the
cold profile from the initial condition of Ocean1. As with Ocean1, this
experiment runs for 20 years.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ocean3-not-available">
<h2>Ocean3 (not available)<a class="headerlink" href="#ocean3-not-available" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Ocean3 begins with the same topography as Ocean1, but in this experiment the
ice draft evolves over time according to a prescribed data set covering 100
years of ice retreat from Ice1r. Ocean3 is initialized and forced with warm
conditions, similar to Ocean0. Strong melting begins immediately as the
sub-ice-shelf circulation spins up, consistent with the conditions for Ice1r
used to generate the topography, and persist for the duration of the experiment.
Again, the topography is
<a class="reference external" href="https://dataservices.gfz-potsdam.de/pik/showshort.php?id=escidoc:1487953">available here</a>.</p>
<p>MPAS-Ocean does not yet support the moving boundaries that this experiment
requires, so it has not yet been implemented in COMPASS.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ocean4-not-available">
<h2>Ocean4 (not available)<a class="headerlink" href="#ocean4-not-available" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Conceptually, Ocean4 is an extension of Ocean3. The ice- draft topography from
Ice1ra was produced by abruptly shutting off melting at year 100 and allowing
the ice to re-advance for 100 years. Thus, Ocean4 begins with the final
topography from Ocean3 (which is also the topography used in Ocean2). This time,
cold initial conditions and restorign are prescribed, leading to very low melt
rates, consistent with the lack of melting in the MISMIP+ run that produced the
ice topography.</p>
<p>Again, MPAS-Ocean does not yet support the moving boundaries, so this experiment
has not yet been implemented in COMPASS.</p>

part of a conda environment, including <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">xarray</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dask</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">numpy</span></code>,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">progressbar2</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">netcdf4</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">shapely</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">matplotlib</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ffmpeg</span></code> and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">scipy</span></code>.  These are all part of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">compass</span></code> environment defined by the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">compass</span></code> package, so if you have already installed and activated the latest
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">compass</span></code>, you’re all set.  If you are on a supported machine, such as on
LANL IC, you can activate with a command like:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nb">source</span> /usr/projects/climate/SHARED_CLIMATE/anaconda_envs/base/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
conda activate compass_0.1.8
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Once you have an appropriate conda environment, run:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>python -m viz
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If you are running Ocean1 or Ocean2, you need to specify this.  Ocean0 is the
default experiment.  to see the other command-line flags, run:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>python -m viz --help
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Running <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">viz</span></code> will take maybe 10 or 15 minutes (most of it on the overturning
streamfunction).  You should see something like:</p>

<p>The more interesting results should be a series of movies in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">movies</span></code> and 4
time series plots in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">plots</span></code> (mean melt rate, total melt flux, mean thermal
driving and mean friction velocity) and the same plots in
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">timeSeriesBelow300m</span></code>, but this time averaged only over the deepest part of
the ice shelf (where much of the action is).</p>
