The Jablonowski and Williamson baroclinic wave test case.

Steps to run this test case:

1. Link the init_atmosphere_model and atmosphere_model executables from the top-level MPAS directory.

2. Run init_atmosphere_model to create initial conditions.
   The log file may show WARNING messages; these can generally be ignored.

3. Run atmosphere_model

4. Run the bwave_surface_p.ncl script to produce plots of surface pressure each simulated day.
