***********************WARNING***************************
The e3sm_coupling step is a work in progress, and is not
fully functional. Use at this point is intended only for
testing purposes.

After running run.py, the directory assembled_files_for_upload is populated
with links. The directory structure is identical to the E3SM inputdata
directory found here:
https://web.lcrc.anl.gov/public/e3sm/inputdata/

The linked  file names are correct and ready for the inputdata repo. To grab
them all, you can use the commands:
   cd assembled_files_for_upload
   tar cvf inputdata.tar inputdata -h
and then copy the tar file to another machine.

E3SM members should consult with an expert from the team to get help and
approval before moving files to the data server.  Currently, the files produced
here are not ready for includsion in E3SM and should not be uploaded. In the
future, when this process produces a usable set of input files, experts may
upload the data to the LCRC inputdata server by following instructions here:
