abstract = {The visualization of scientific data is both a science and an art, in which many tools are used to explore, discover and communicate the information within the data. This process is increasingly difficult, as the size and complexity of data is constantly advancing. Color is a potent tool in scientific data visualization, and has been well studied. However, color’s full potential for communication and discovery remains untapped. Effective use of color requires a depth of understanding and experience employing color and color relationships, in combination with tools to translate that knowledge into scientific visualization workflows. In this paper, we present ColorMoves, an interactive tool that promotes exploration of scientific data through artist-driven color methods in a unique and transformative way. We discuss the power of contrast in scientific visualization, the design of the ColorMoves tool, and the tool’s application in several science domains.},

abstract = {Visualizations benefit from the use of intuitive colors, enabling an observer to make use of more automatic, subconscious channels. In this paper, we apply the concept of intuitive color to the generation of thematic colormaps for the environmental sciences. In particular, we provide custom sets of colormaps for water, atmosphere, land, and vegetation. These have been integrated into the online tool: ColorMoves: The Environment to enable the environmental scientist to tailor them precisely to the data and tasks in a simple drag-and-drop workflow.},
