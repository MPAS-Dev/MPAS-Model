This directory creates a very coarse 200 to 40 km variable resolution mesh for Antarctica
that can be used for rapid testing with a (semi-) realistic geometry,

The variable resolution mesh is generated using JIGSAW-GEO:
https://github.com/dengwirda/jigsaw-geo-matlab
JIGSAW-GEO needs to be run manually from Matlab before running the rest of this case.
(It may be possible to include that step in the set up process, but it seems like
more trouble than it is worth for now.)

To create the mesh, run the .m script in the subdirectory 'jigsaw',
and then copy or link the resulting .msh file into this directory.

Also, a source file for interpolating the initial condition must be specified.
By default, the system looks for: antarctica_8km_2018_04_20.nc
This file must be copied/linked into the test case setup directory, or a
different file can be used instead if the test case is adjusted.
Similarly, the script will look for a temperature IC file called
ais_temp_pattyn_cism_format.5km.filled.nc.

After this is complete, set up and run the test case as normal.
