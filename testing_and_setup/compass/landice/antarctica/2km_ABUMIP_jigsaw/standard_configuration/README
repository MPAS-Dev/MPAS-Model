This directory creates a 2-20 km variable resolution mesh for Antarctica
for ABUMIP - specifically uses highest resolution in all vulnerable marine sectors.

The variable resolution mesh is generated using JIGSAW-GEO:
https://github.com/dengwirda/jigsaw-geo-matlab
JIGSAW-GEO needs to be run manually from Matlab before running the rest of this case.
(It may be possible to include that step in the set up process, but it seems like
more trouble than it is worth for now.)

To create the mesh, run the .m script in the subdirectory 'jigsaw',
and then copy or link the resulting file into this directory.

Also, a source file for interpolating the initial condition must be specified.
By default, the system looks for: antarctica_2km_2014_01_14.nc
This file must be copied/linked into the test case setup directory, or a
different file can be used instead if the test case is adjusted.

After this is complete, set up and run the test case as normal.
