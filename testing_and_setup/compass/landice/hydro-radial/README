This test case is based off of:
Bueler, E. & Pelt, W. Van, 2015. Mass-conserving subglacial hydrology in the Parallel Ice Sheet Model version 0.6. Geoscientific Model Development, 8, pp.1613â€“1635.

See sections 5.3-5.4, 7.1 and Figures 2, 3, and 5.

The test uses a nearly-exact solution for the steady state configuration of a radially symmetric ice sheet.
It includes nontrivial profiles of ice overburden pressure and sliding.
The solution is determined through numerical solution of a 1-d ODE initial value problem.
Ed Bueler shared his Matlab code that generates the solution, and I have added those .m files to this directory.
He has the code available publicly here: https://github.com/bueler/hydrolakes/tree/master/codes

As described in the GMD paper, the test is applied by generating a near-exact solution for water thickness and
water pressure, given a profile of glacier geometry, a profile of sliding, a spatially-uniform melt input,
various parameter values, and a specified initial value of water thickness at the margin.  The solution provides
a steady-state profile of water thickness and water pressure for these inputs.

Then, the numerical model (MPAS in this case, PISM originally) is initialized with these radial profiles of waterThickness
and waterPressure, interpolated onto the 2-d numerical grid.  In the paper, they then describe how the model
is integrated forward in time for one month, and error in the final state of waterThickness and waterPressure is
assessed.  Because the model was initialized to the near-exact steady-state solution, any drift away from that
initial condition should be due to numerical error.

Optionally, you can also manually run setup_mpas_radial_IC.m using Matlab.  This sets up the near-exact SS solution for
waterThickness and waterPressure into the MPAS input file, as well as update a
text file that contains the exact solution.  The path to the MPAS input file needs to be manually specified
in the script code.  This is only necessary if you want to regenerate the txt
file with the near-exact solution.  Otherwise, the comitted txt file includes
the solution fields necessary to set up the MPAS initial condition and to
compare the MPAS solution against.

Ideally, the error plot would be repeated for multiple resolutions to generate a convergence plot like GMD Fig. 5.

As of this commit, MPAS demonstrates similar error to PISM (GMD Fig. 5) for the 1km resolution I have run with.
However, inpsection of the MPAS results shows that there is an issue at the margin of water being unable to
flow out of the last cell with ice effectively because the hydropotential gradient there is artificially low
there due to discretization error (and perhaps incorrect treatment at boundaries?).  The net effect is that
waterThickness just increases indefinitely at the margin cells.  Though the waterThickness there quickly
surpasses Wr and keeps going, it seems to have minimal effect on the solution in the interior for the one month
run.  However, it's not clear what will happen over longer time periods.  Interestingly, the error in the MPAS
solution after one month is very similar to the error in the PISM solution reported in the GMD paper.  So it's
possible that PISM has the same problem, or else that this error isn't important enough after 1 month to matter
much.  (Given that these margin cells have by far the largest errors, I suspect that is mostly what we are seeing
in the error metric, though.)  The other possibility is that this error metric is not strict enough to
identify problems...

Note that alternatively it is possible to run this test case to steady state from an initial condition of
no water (or very little water).  That is what this test does.

It runs long enough to reach steady state.  Then the modeled profiles of waterThickness and waterPressure
can be compared to figures 2 and 3 in the GMD paper.

Results appear to match based on the eyeball norm.  A quantitative error metric could be added.

./plot_hydro-radial_profile.py can be used for this test as well to visualize the output.

Notes on this:
Ed Bueler said he's not sure that they ever did that.
One thing that is not clear to me is how the initial value on water thickness required by the
near-exact solution applies in this configuration.  It may be necessary to impose a Dirichlet b.c.
on waterThickness to force the value at the margin to match the value at the margin in the near-exact solution.
Otherwise the MPAS modeled value at the margin may not match the initial value used by the near-exact solution,
and the comparison is less meaningful.
