1) Edit the Makefile to set appropriate compilers and compiler flags.
   The main loop of the Lloyd iteration code is parallelized with OpenMP,
   so if desired, OpenMP flags may be specified in FFLAGS and LDFLAGS.

2) Run 'make' to create an executable, grid_gen, in the src directory, as
   well as a symbolic link to the executable in the top-level directory.
