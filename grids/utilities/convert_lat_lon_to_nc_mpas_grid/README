GRID_GEN README

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The grid_gen utility converts a set of generating points into a complete MPAS
input file, grid.nc. Additionally, grid_gen creates a graph description file
suitable for use with METIS, plots of the initial Delaunay triangulation and
final Delaunay triangulation (after any further adjustment by grid_gen), and 
a list of the final generating points.



Input files:

     namelist.input - a Fortran namelist with the following variables
           np - the number of generating points in the locs.dat input file
           n_scvt_iterations - the number of Lloyd iterations to perform, 
                  beginning with the generating points in the locs.dat file, 
                  using the density function specified programmatically in 
                  src/module_scvt.F::density_for_point(). Even in the iteration
                  has converged, when the maximum number of iterations has been
                  reached, grid.nc and graph.info file will be created. 
           restart_interval - the number of Lloyd iterations to perform 
                  between writes of a 'restart.dat' file, which can be used
                  in place of a 'locs.dat' input file to restart the iteration
           eps - the convergence criterion for the Lloyd iteration; when the L2
                  movement of generating points falls below this threshold, 
                  the mesh will be considered to have converged, and the program
                  will create  grid.nc and graph.info files
           min_dx - if set to a value >0, causes the code to invoke 
                  a Monte-Carlo method to estimate the total number of 
                  generating points needed to achieve the specified minimum dx 
                  (in meters) based on the density function defined in 
                  src/module_scvt.F::density_for_point()
           filenames for input and output (added by Peixoto)
       
	
     locs.dat - a list of generating points, either given as (lat,lon) 
           coordinates or as (x,y,z) coordinates; the coorinates used in the 
           file should be indicated to grid_gen using the locs_as_xyz logical 
           value in the namelist.input file.

	   The format of the file for (x,y,z) coordinates has a header line
           giving the number of generating points and the maximum degree of any 
           node in the Delaunay triangulation, followed by np lines with the 
           format '(10x,f22.10,f23.10,f23.10)' giving the x, y, and z 
           coordinates (on the unit sphere) of each generating point.

           The format of the file for (lat,lon) coordinates has np lines with 
           the format '(f13.10,1x,f13.10)' giving the latitude and longitude 
           coorinates of each generating point.



Output files:

     scvt_initial.ps - a plot of the Delaunay triangulation of the generating 
           points specified in the locs.dat file
 
     scvt_final.ps - a plot of the Delaunay triangulation of the final
           generating points, after adjustment by the number of Lloyd iterations
           specified in the namelist.input file
 
     locs.dat.out - a list of the final generating points, after adjustment by 
           the number of Lloyd iterations specified in the namelist.input file.
           This file also contains a list of refinement points appended to 
           the list of final generating points, allowing this file to be used
           as input for the generation of a mesh with twice the resolution.

     restart.dat - a list of generating points that can be used as input 
           (i.e., locs.dat) for a successive set of iterations if the program 
           was prematurely stopped
 
     graph.info - a description of the output mesh in a format suitable for use
           with METIS to produce graph decomposition files for MPAS
 
     grid.nc - an MPAS input file
