grid_hcm: conververts grid to HCm positioning overwritting the edge info
 
This routine is no longer necessary for MPAS-A, since it is possible for select the 
hcm grid option when generating the initial conditions in init_atmosphere

I. OVERVIEW

   This standalone application converts a spherical NetCDF mesh to HCm type and saves the
   output to a new NetCDF file. 

   This is a standalone application written in Fortran90.


II. BUILDING THE CODE

   This standalone consists of the files: convert_grid_to_hcm.f90 and
   Makefile

   Building requires NetCDF and a Fortran compiler.

   Update the Makefile to use your preferred compiler and make certain the
   environment variable NETCDF points to your installation of NetCDF; make


III.  RUNNING THE CODE

   Execute the application and specify as command-line arguments the NetCDF file
   that is to be rotated and the name to be given the generated output file.

      > grid_rotate input_filename.nc output_filename.nc


IV.   ADDITIONAL TOOLS
    
   The NCL file mesh.ncl is included with this application and can be used to
   plot grids before and after rotation.  To plot a file, modify the input
   filename on the line: 

      f = addfile("grid.nc","r")

   and run the script: 

      > ncl mesh.ncl
