 gsw_data_v3_0.nc
 NetCDF file that contains the global data set of Absolute Salinity Anomaly
 Ratio, the global data set of Absolute Salinity Anomaly atlas, and check
 values and computation accuracy values for use in gsw_check_function.
 The data set gsw_data_v3_0.nc must not be tampered with.

 gsw_check_function.f90
 Contains the check functions. We suggest that after downloading, unzipping
 and installing the toolbox the user runs this program to ensure that the
 toolbox is installed correctly and there are no conflicts. This toolbox has
 been tested to compile and run with gfortran.

 cd test
 make
 ./gsw_check

 Note that gfortran is the name of the GNU Fortran project, developing a
 free Fortran 95/2003/2008 compiler for GCC, the GNU Compiler Collection.
 It is available from http://gcc.gnu.org/fortran/
